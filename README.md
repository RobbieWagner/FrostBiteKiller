# FrostBiteKiller
Top Down 2D Survival horror game


It is a cold, dark night.
A lone car speeds down a country road towards its destination.
Along the road, the driver notices a strange figure approach.
The driver swerves out of the way of the figure, only to crash into a nearby tree.
What was that figure in the road, and what will the driver do now that their car is totalled in the middle of nowhere.

Frostbite Killer is a 2D, topdown horror game where you will attempt to escape from an unknown entity trying to hunt you down.
Wander the cold landscape, interact with the world, and, in any way possible, survive the entity that is chasing you.
